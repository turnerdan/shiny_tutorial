# shiny tutorial

This is an introduction to `shiny`, an `R` package that supports building web applications using `R` code. This makes it ideal for building interactive data visualizations.

The tutorial begins by reviewing the `tidyverse` with special attention paid to `ggplot2`. Then it breaks down the main components of a working app and overviews many of the available options for making reactive R scripts to feed your visualizations:

* The first part is the UI, which takes user some kind of user input and shows the user some kind of rendered output.
* The second part is the server, which takes the user input, manipulates the data accordingly, and renders whatever it is that the UI is set to display.

Lastly, I show how easy it is to deploy your app online using RStudio's shinyapps.io hosting service.

Enjoy!
