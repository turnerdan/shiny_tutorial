# shiny tutorial

This is an introduction to `shiny`, an `R` package that supports building web applications using `R` code. This makes it ideal for building interactive data visualizations.

Check out some examples of shiny apps here: https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/#user-showcase

The tutorial begins by reviewing the `tidyverse` with special attention paid to `ggplot2`. Then it breaks down the main components of a working app:

* The first part is the **UI**, which takes some kind of user input and shows the user some kind of rendered output.
* The second part is the **server**, which takes the user input, manipulates the data accordingly, and renders whatever it is that the UI is set to display.

The middle part of the tutorial is all about how to add advanced styling to your app, and it ends with instructions on how to deploy your app online using RStudio's shinyapps.io hosting service.

Enjoy!
